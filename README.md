Computercraft
=============

I wrote a bunch of programs when I was playing the Computercraft mod in Minecraft. 

My 'magnum opus' of this series is 'ed' the in-game editor. The mod came with a terrible stock editor and I saw fit to improve it. In addition to duplicating the basic text editor I added optional line numbering, an optional status bar, a configuration menu, save states across sessions, dynamic window size, many 'standard' text-editor improvement, and in-editor execution and debugging.
